- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @T-Draco
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating bioinformatics-based modules, or utilizing GitHub modules for biological sciences and data analysis. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Biotechnology and Bioinformatics.
- âš¡ Fun facts: Draco is the name of my dog. I learned I enjoy learning about computers much later in my studies while working towards an M.S. in Biotechnology. I like video games.
